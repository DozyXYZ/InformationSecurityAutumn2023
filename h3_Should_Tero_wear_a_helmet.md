## Shostack 2022: Welcome to the Worlds Shortest Threat Modeling Course

The author discussed why we do threat modelling and the 4 Questions Framework

Why threat modelling? </br>
> We anticipate the problem when they're inexpensive to deal with them. </br>
> Think about threats before building anything so we have more approaches to handle. </br>

4 Questions Framework: Answer these questions to have a struture and add more details with consistency and precise.

1) What are we working on? </br>
> Collaborate to get everyone on the same table and add their ideas. </br>
> Sketch or structure the projects so that people can engage and respond. It is an imperfect start but will get better over time. </br>
> Record or document the process so we can look back, add more details, and learn new things. </br>
> Data flow diagrams with 5 entities: Processes, External Entities, Boundaries, Data Flow, Data Stores. </br>
> More details: https://github.com/adamshostack/DFD3/ </br>

2) What can go wrong? </br>
> Models such as STRIDE or cyber kill chain help us consistently think about threats, structure them, and find the answers. </br>
> - STRIDE: Spoofing, Tampering, Repediation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privileges </br>
> - Cyber Kill Chain: Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command and Control, Actions on Objectives </br>

3) What are we going to do? </br>
> Track and treat the problems as development items in the backlog in the design process. </br>
> Make sure you do something about it. </br>
> Threat modelling informs risk management to quantify the probability or the impact to make the right decisions. </br>

4) Did we do a good job? </br>
> Would you recommend the solution to your colleague? </br>
> - Yes -> you did a good one </br>
> - No -> you have not done a good job yet. Try again :D </br>
