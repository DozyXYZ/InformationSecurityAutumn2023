## Shostack 2022: Welcome to the Worlds Shortest Threat Modeling Course

The author discussed why we do threat modelling and the 4 Questions Framework

Why threat modelling? </br>
> We anticipate the problem when they're inexpensive to deal with them. </br>
> Think about threats before building anything so we have more approaches to handle. </br>

4 Questions Framework: Answer these questions to have a struture and add more details with consistency and precise.

1) What are we working on? </br>
> Collaborate to get everyone on the same table and add their ideas. </br>
> Sketch or structure the projects so that people can engage and respond. It is an imperfect start but will get better over time. </br>
> Record or document the process so we can look back, add more details, and learn new things. </br>
> Data flow diagrams with 5 entities: Processes, External Entities, Boundaries, Data Flow, Data Stores. </br>
