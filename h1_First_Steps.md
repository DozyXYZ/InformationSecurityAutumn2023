## Summarize Darknet Diaries Ep 124: Synthetic Remmittance
The story is about how the 43 years old Evaldas Rimasaukas from Lithuania uses a scam named BEC – Business E-mail Compromise to phish more than $100 million from Facebook and Google.

Evaldas and co. researched and gathered information about the targets: Facebook, Google and other multinational companies in key personnel (who wrote the check to pay the invoices), financial processes (accounting and financial department) and communication channels. The attacker’s team looked for phone numbers in Facebook and Google employees’ email then called them to gather more information of the key people, the process, the companies’ partners. They found Quanta Computer and repeated the process to research Quanta Computer.

The scammers crafted a sophisticated BEC scam, creating legitimate appeared Quanta Computer employees’ email address, Quanta Computer’s invoices and contracts. Then he sent those emails with invoices to Facebook and Google to trick the companies send the money to his bank account rather than Quanta Computer bank account. AND THEY DID! Over the course of 2 years, the scammers successfully scammed and laundered $23 millions from Google and $98 million from Facebook.

The scam was busted when the companies figured out the discrepancies in payments. The FBI was contacted. After tracing the paper trail, they discovered the domain of to make the fake Quanta email look legitimate was registered by Evaldas using ... his personal email. He was arrested by the Lithuanian government and extradited to the U.S.A. He was sentenced to 5 years in prison and fined $26 millions. Google and Facebook managed to recovered most of the money and a valuable lessons that security is everyone’s responsibility.

## Summarize Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains (Hutchins E., Cloppert M. & Amin R.)

Traditional defense tools (like intrusion detection and anti-virus) focus on vulnerability risk. Conventional incident response assumes a successful intrusion. Evolving goals and sophistication of cyber intrusions have made these methods inadequate for specific actors.

A new threat class, known as "Advanced Persistent Threat" (APT), involves skilled adversaries conducting long-term intrusions for sensitive information. APTs use advanced tools to bypass traditional network defenses.

Knowledge about these threats enables an intelligence feedback loop, helping defenders gain an information advantage and reducing adversary success chances over time. An intrusion "kill chain" model outlines intrusion phases, mapping adversary indicators to defender actions. Recognizing patterns linking intrusions forms the basis of intelligence-driven computer network defense (CND). This approach reduces the likelihood of adversary success, guides defense investments, and provides performance metrics.

An intelligence-based model is crucial due to the evolving nature of advanced persistent threats, addressing both vulnerability and threat components of risk.

### Intrusion Kill Chain

Kill chain is a process to engage adversaries systematically for desired outcomes. Kill chain is an integrated end-to-end process; any deficiency disrupts it.

New kill chain for intrusions: reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control (C2), actions on objectives.

1.	Reconnaissance involves target research and selection from sources like websites.
2.	Weaponization combines remote access trojans and exploits, often using files like PDFs.
3.	Delivery: transmitting weapon to target via email, websites, USB media.
4.	Exploitation triggers intruder's code after delivery, targeting vulnerabilities.
5.	Installation of trojan/backdoor enables persistent access for adversaries.
6.	Command and Control (C2): compromised hosts connect to internet server for manual control.
7.	Actions on Objectives: intruders pursue goals like data exfiltration, integrity breaches, or lateral movement.

### Courses of Action

The defenders align their defensive system accordingly to the intrusion kill chain’s specific processes. Defenders measure effectiveness, plan roadmaps to bridge the gap between them and the intrusion. The approach is the essence of intelligent-driven Computer Network Defense: make decisions and measurements based on a deep understanding of the adversary.

The course of actions can be described in a 7x6 matrix with the 7 phases of intrusion kill chains and 6 phases of actions: detect, deny, disrupt, degrade, deceive, and destroy. Various defense techniques are being deployed in each course of actions to counter the intrusion kill chain. The counterattack can be sophisticated or sometimes it just requires the users to be cautious, for example, not click or download files on fishy emails.

Resiliency is the defender’s top priority when faced with evolving adversaries. The most notable adaptations are in the exploits phase. When the adversaries deploy an exploit but reuse observable tools or infrastructure in other phases and the defenders have mitigations for those, the defenders will force the adversaries to improve their attack and thereby increases the adversaries’ cost to attack the defenders. The defenders can measure the performance and effectiveness of defensive actions to generate the metric for resiliency. Using the kill chain to frame the metrics, the defenders can achieve the upper hand and identify priorities to mitigate the intrusions.
