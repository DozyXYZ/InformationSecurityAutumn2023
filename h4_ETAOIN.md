# Task z) Password Manager: LastPass

## What threats does it protect against?

* Password Theft: Bitwarden helps protect against password theft by securely storing and managing passwords in an encrypted vault, reducing the need for users to remember or write down passwords.</br>
* Brute Force Attacks: Bitwarden encourages the use of strong, unique passwords for each account, making it difficult for attackers to guess passwords through brute force.</br>
* Phishing: Bitwarden can help users avoid falling victim to phishing attacks by autofilling login credentials only on legitimate websites and not on phishing pages.</br>
* Data Breaches: By storing passwords securely and enabling two-factor authentication (2FA), Bitwarden mitigates the impact of data breaches, as stolen passwords alone are insufficient to gain access to accounts.
